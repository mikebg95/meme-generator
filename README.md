This app was made as part of the intermediate Scrimba React course. The app is a meme generator where the user can generate a random meme image from a list of images from an imported data file. The user can add a top text and a bottom text to the meme image to create a meme.

The goals of the app were to:

(1) get familiar with React concepts like passing and destructuring props, children, and reusable components 
(2) get familiar with State Management, useEffect hooks, conditional rendering, local and unified state, event listeners, and React forms.
(2) practice implementing SCSS styling based on Figma designs 
(3) get familiar with continous deployment on Netlify through Github.

The deployed end product can be viewed at:
